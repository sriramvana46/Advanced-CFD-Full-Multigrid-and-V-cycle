This repository provides a one-dimensional solver for the differential equation −u′′(x)+σu(x)=f(x) with homogeneous boundary conditions, discretized using the finite difference method. The solution is accelerated via both V-cycle and Full Multigrid algorithms. The implementation demonstrates efficient multigrid techniques for model elliptic problems
