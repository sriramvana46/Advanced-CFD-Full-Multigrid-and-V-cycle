This repository contains an implementation of the unsteady Navier-Stokes equations solver for the 2D lid-driven cavity problem using the fractional step (projection) method. The code simulates incompressible fluid flow in a square domain where the top boundary is driven by a constant velocity, generating complex vortical structures over time.

Key features:

   Time-dependent simulation of 2D incompressible flow.

   Fractional step method (Chorinâ€™s projection) for pressure-velocity coupling.

   Easily customizable boundary conditions and solver parameters.
